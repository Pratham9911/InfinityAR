- **Important:**  
  - Do **NOT** track large files like `saturn.blend` and `vuforia engine` package in Git. Keep them locally or download when needed.
  - Use Git LFS to track `.fbx`, `.png`, and other large assets:
    ```
    git lfs track "*.fbx"
    git lfs track "*.png"
    ```
  - Always commit from the main Unity project directory or set up a symlink to avoid duplication.
- Add new features in Unity’s **main folder**, and GitHub folder will automatically pick changes if symlinked.
- Update this README when adding new scenes or features.
